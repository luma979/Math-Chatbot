            <p>
                I want to teach you how to assess your own knowledge that you have about a subject area. Let’s do this 
                by taking an example that you already know. Suppose you wanted to assess your own knowledge about solving 
                2-step equations of the form ax + b = c. An example of this type of problem is 2x + 3 = 15. If I want to be 
                able to solve problems like these, I need four types of knowledge. These are facts, strategies, procedures, 
                and rationales. Fact are concepts you have that describe objects or elements. For example, for two step 
                equations, I need to know what variables, constants, coefficients, equations, and expressions are. Strategies 
                are general processes I would use to solve a problem. For two step equations, this would be reverse order of 
                operations. Procedures are the specific steps that I would use in a strategy. So if I am using reverse order 
                of operations, I need to know additive and multiplicative inverses. Finally, I need to know rationales which 
                are the reasons why the strategies or the procedures work the way they do. For example, this could include 
                things like the subtraction or the division property of equality that says that when you do the same operation 
                to both sides of an equation, you preserve the value of the equation. You can think of facts as telling you 
                “what”, strategies and procedures as telling you “how” and rationales as telling you “why”.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, this is how I might assess my own knowledge of solving two step equations. For facts, I 
                need to know what variables, constants, coefficients, equations and expressions are. A variable is an unknown 
                quantity, usually represented by a letter. A constant is a specific number. A coefficient is a number that you 
                multiply a variable by like 2x. An equation is an expression that is equally to another expression and the 
                two expressions are joined by an equal sign. An expression is one or more terms that are combined by 
                mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
            </p>
            <p>
                For strategies, I need to know reverse order of operations which is SADMEP. This stands for subtraction, 
                addition, division, multiplication, exponents and parentheses. I know that I’m supposed to do these in order 
                but I don’t remember whether I’m supposed to do subtraction always before addition or just which one goes 
                first. The same is true for division and multiplication.
            </p>
            <p>
                For procedures, I need to know additive inverse and multiplicative inverse. The additive inverse is taking the 
                number with the opposite sign as the constant and adding it to both sides of the equation. The multiplicative 
                inverse is taking the inverse of the coefficient of the variable and multiplying both sides of the equation 
                by it. However, if the coefficient is negative, I’m not sure if the multiplicative inverse is supposed to be 
                negative as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                For rationales, I believe the two rationales I need are the subtraction property of equality and the division 
                property of equality. The subtraction property of equality says that if I subtract the same number from both 
                sides, which is what I’m doing with the additive inverse, I preserve the equality. Similarly, the division 
                property of equality says that if I divide both sides of the equation by the same number, which is what I’m 
                doing with the multiplicative inverse, I preserve the equality.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I look over what I wrote, I see that I am good with my facts. On my strategy, I’m not sure about the 
                order of steps in reverse order of operations when it comes to subtraction and addition or multiplication 
                and division, so I need to learn those. On procedures, I’m not sure what to do with multiplicative inverses 
                when the coefficient is negative, so I need to learn that as well. For rationales, I think I’m OK. I don’t 
                think I have any missing facts/concepts that I left out that I should know or I didn’t list any facts/concepts 
                where I didn’t know what they were. For the strategy, I believe I listed the correct strategy and parts of the 
                strategy, but I wasn’t sure about some of the ordering of steps in the strategy. For procedures, I was good 
                on the additive inverse but had a question on carrying out the multiplicative inverse when the coeffcient was 
                negative. For rationales, I think I had all the rationales that were important and that I understood them as 
                well. I don’t think I left anything out.
